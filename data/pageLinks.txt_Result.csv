"ALL NATURALS Salt Lamp Unique Diwali Gift Rare Grey Mountain Shaped Hand-Carved 7-8 Inch Height 2-3 Kg(Wire & Spare Pigmy Bulb), Natural Air Purifier, for Vastu, Healing, Peace & Harmony","3.0 out of 5 stars","NOT HAVING A HIMALAYAN SALT LAMP IN YOUR HOME OR OFFICE IS LIKE NOT HAVING A WINDOW!! All Naturals Himalayan Pink Salt Lamp is exactly what you need to bring positivity to your surroundings, and, most importantly to your mind, in these stressful times, along with a unique addition to your décor.
HOW A SALT LAMP WORKS: Salt, being hygroscopic, attracts water molecules from the air that hold dirt, pollen, smoke and bacteria. When heated, the lamp evaporates the water and the pollutants remain on the lamp. This purifies the air. When heated, the lamp releases negative ions into the air neutralizing the positive ions released by appliances like Mobiles, Laptops, TV, Fridge, AC etc., thereby reducing static electricity and electromagnetic radiation, resulting in sound sleep.
BENEFITS OF A SALT LAMP: Promotes sound sleep. Purifies & Deodorizes the Air. Neutralizes Electromagnetic Radiation. Eases Coughing. May reduce symptoms of Allergy & Asthma. Improves Mood & Concentration. Reduce Static Electricity in the Air. Known to increase Energy Levels. Environmentally-Friendly – Runs on 15W inexpensive bulb (Pigmy or Fridge bulb).
PACKAGE CONTENTS: 1 Himalayan Rock Salt Lamp With 2 Pigmy Bulb 15W (for heating) and 1 Power Cable with Holder . SHAPE: Hand-carved Mountain Shape DIMENSIONS: 12 cm x 12 cm x 22 cm WEIGHT: 3-5 KG COLOR: Pink
PLACING YOUR SALT LAMP: From research, every half kilogram of Himalayan Salt Crystal cleans up the air in about 4 x 4 feet area. So, a lamp up to 5 Kg is good enough for a bedroom, whereas for a large living room or open area, a bigger lamp (7-15 Kg) may be more suitable. The best places to place a salt lamp are bed sides, study tables, side tables or your office reception tables. KEEP AWAY FROM WATER TO AVOID SALT FROM DISSOLVING

"VMTC Smoke Stop Air Purifier Filter with True Activated Carbon for Blueair 400 Series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","VMTC Smoke Stop Air purifier Filter with true Activated carbon for Blueair 400. Designed specifically to fit the Blueair Classic 400 series. Particle filter with active carbon for use in rooms where removal of heavy gaseous pollutants, such as tobacco smoke or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is required. Effective against PM 2.5, Pollen, Dust, Pet Dander, Mood, Bacteria, Virus, Dust Mites, VOCs, Smoke, Cooking Odour, Chemicals.
Airborne particles pass through a chamber of the VMTC air purifier to get electrically charged before passing through the gradient structure of our filters. The charge causes the polluted particles to adhere effortlessly to the filter media, capturing even fine particles such as tobacco smoke.
The gradient structure of VMTC filters traps particles of all sizes while maintaining maximum airflow. It resists clogging and wont re-release particles back into the air, even when the filter is heavily loaded. VMTC filter media is ultrasonically bonded to prevent filter fibers and other particles from being added back into your environment. The only thing that comes out of our filters is clean air!
VMTC Smoke Stop filters have a highly porous structure made of activated carbon to trap gases and odors. The naturally antibacterial polypropylene fibers in VMTC filters prevent bacteria and mold growth, so our filters never put bacteria and mold back into the air.
VMTC filters save energy thanks to its low dense design and the fact that less pressure is needed to push air through the filters. Our filters are also recyclable, so the only thing you’re adding back into the environment is clean air. Due to the use of both electrostatic and mechanical filtration, the filter media in VMTC filters is less dense than comparable media. Lower density enables air to move through the filter at a lower pressure, so you get high performance with a whisper-silent delive

"All Naturals Wrought Iron Basket with Himalayan Rock Salt Chunks USB Natural Air Purifying Lamp for Vastu, Feng Shui, Home Decor (7-inch, Pink)","3.0 out of 5 stars","NOT HAVING A HIMALAYAN SALT LAMP IN YOUR HOME OR OFFICE IS LIKE NOT HAVING A WINDOW!! All Naturals Himalayan Pink Salt Lamp is exactly what you need to bring positivity to your surroundings, and, most importantly to your mind, in these stressful times, along with a unique addition to your décor.
HOW A SALT LAMP WORKS: Salt, being hygroscopic, attracts water molecules from the air that hold dirt, pollen, smoke and bacteria. When heated, the lamp evaporates the water and the pollutants remain on the lamp. This purifies the air. When heated, the lamp releases negative ions into the air neutralizing the positive ions released by appliances like Mobiles, Laptops, TV, Fridge, AC etc., thereby reducing static electricity and electromagnetic radiation, resulting in sound sleep.
BENEFITS OF A SALT LAMP: Promotes sound sleep. Purifies & Deodorizes the Air. Neutralizes Electromagnetic Radiation. Eases Coughing. May reduce symptoms of Allergy & Asthma. Improves Mood & Concentration. Reduce Static Electricity in the Air. Known to increase Energy Levels. Environmentally-Friendly – Runs on 15W inexpensive bulb (Pigmy or Fridge bulb).
PACKAGE CONTENTS: 1 Himalayan Rock Salt Lamp With 2 Pigmy Bulb 15W (for heating) and 1 Power Cable with Holder & ON/OFF switch.
PLACING YOUR SALT LAMP: From research, every half kilogram of Himalayan Salt Crystal cleans up the air in about 4 x 4 feet area. So, a lamp up to 5 Kg is good enough for a bedroom, whereas for a large living room or open area, a bigger lamp (8-15 Kg) may be more suitable. The best places to place a salt lamp is bed sides, study tables, side tables or your office reception tables. KEEP AWAY FROM WATER TO AVOID SALT FROM DISSOLVING

"VMTC Smoke Stop Air Purifier Filter with True Activated Carbon for Blueair 200/300 Series.","2.0 out of 5 stars","VMTC Smoke Stop Air purifier Filter with true Activated carbon for Blueair 200/300. Fits 270E Slim, 270E. Particle filter with active carbon for use in rooms where removal of heavy gaseous pollutants, such as tobacco smoke or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is required. Effective against PM 2.5, Pollen, Dust, Pet Dander, Mood, Bacteria, Virus, Dust Mites, VOCs, Smoke, Cooking Odour, Chemicals.
Airborne particles pass through a chamber of the VMTC air purifier to get electrically charged before passing through the gradient structure of our filters. The charge causes the polluted particles to adhere effortlessly to the filter media, capturing even fine particles such as tobacco smoke.
The gradient structure of VMTC filters traps particles of all sizes while maintaining maximum airflow. It resists clogging and wont re-release particles back into the air, even when the filter is heavily loaded. VMTC filter media is ultrasonically bonded to prevent filter fibers and other particles from being added back into your environment. The only thing that comes out of our filters is clean air!
VMTC Smoke Stop filters have a highly porous structure made of activated carbon to trap gases and odors. The naturally antibacterial polypropylene fibers in VMTC filters prevent bacteria and mold growth, so our filters never put bacteria and mold back into the air.
VMTC filters save energy thanks to its low dense design and the fact that less pressure is needed to push air through the filters. Our filters are also recyclable, so the only thing you’re adding back into the environment is clean air. Due to the use of both electrostatic and mechanical filtration, the filter media in VMTC filters is less dense than comparable media. Lower density enables air to move through the filter at a lower pressure, so you get high performance with a whisper-silent delive

"All Naturals Salt Lamp Unique Diwali Gift Rare Grey Mountain Shaped Hand-Carved 7-8 Inch Height 2-3 Kg with On/Off Wire, Natural Air Purifier for Vastu, Feng Shui, Home Decor, Healing, Peace & Harmony","5.0 out of 5 stars","THE MOST UNIQUE SALT LAMP ON AMAZON: All Naturals brings to you the most unique salt lamp in a natural grey colour with shades of white, a rare find from the salt mines that produce mostly pink rock salt. Unlike regular pink salt lamps, warm amber/yellow light peeps through translucent portions giving a vey soothing effect, and, is perfect for those who prefer dim lighting in their bedrooms. Each grey lamp emits its own unique light depending on its crystal structure.
HOW A SALT LAMP WORKS: Salt, being hygroscopic, attracts water molecules from the air that hold dirt, pollen, smoke and bacteria. When heated, the lamp evaporates the water and the pollutants remain on the lamp. This purifies the air. When heated, the lamp releases negative ions into the air neutralizing the positive ions released by appliances like Mobiles, Laptops, TV, Fridge, AC etc., thereby reducing static electricity and electromagnetic radiation, resulting in sound sleep.
BENEFITS OF A SALT LAMP: Promotes sound sleep. Purifies & Deodorizes the Air. Neutralizes Electromagnetic Radiation. Eases Coughing. May reduce symptoms of Allergy & Asthma. Improves Mood & Concentration. Reduce Static Electricity in the Air. Known to increase Energy Levels. Environmentally-Friendly – Runs on 15W inexpensive bulb (Pigmy or Fridge bulb).
PACKAGE CONTENTS: 1 Himalayan Rock Salt Lamp With 2 Pigmy Bulb and 1 Power Cable with Holder . SHAPE: Mountain like DIMENSIONS: 11 cm x 11 cm x 20 cm WEIGHT: 2-3 KG COLOR: Predominantly Grey with Natural White Spots/Patterns/Patches
PLACING YOUR SALT LAMP: From research, every half kilogram of Himalayan Salt Crystal cleans up the air in about 4 x 4 feet area. So, a lamp up to 5 Kg is good enough for a bedroom, whereas for a large living room or open area, a bigger lamp (7-15 Kg) may be more suitable. The best places to place a salt lamp are bed sides, study tables, side tables or your office reception tables. KEEP AWAY FROM WATER TO AVOID SALT FROM DISSOLVING

"All Naturals Salt Lamp Unique Iron Basket with Salt Chunks (On/Off Wire), Natural Air Purifier for Vastu, Feng Shui, Home Decor, Healing, Peace & Harmony","2.9 out of 5 stars","NOT HAVING A HIMALAYAN SALT LAMP IN YOUR HOME OR OFFICE IS LIKE NOT HAVING A WINDOW!! All Naturals Himalayan Pink Salt Lamp is exactly what you need to bring positivity to your surroundings, and, most importantly to your mind, in these stressful times, along with a unique addition to your décor.
HOW A SALT LAMP WORKS: Salt, being hygroscopic, attracts water molecules from the air that hold dirt, pollen, smoke and bacteria. When heated, the lamp evaporates the water and the pollutants remain on the lamp. This purifies the air. When heated, the lamp releases negative ions into the air neutralizing the positive ions released by appliances like Mobiles, Laptops, TV, Fridge, AC etc., thereby reducing static electricity and electromagnetic radiation, resulting in sound sleep.
BENEFITS OF A SALT LAMP: Promotes sound sleep. Purifies & Deodorizes the Air. Neutralizes Electromagnetic Radiation. Eases Coughing. May reduce symptoms of Allergy & Asthma. Improves Mood & Concentration. Reduce Static Electricity in the Air. Known to increase Energy Levels. Environmentally-Friendly – Runs on 15W inexpensive bulb (Pigmy or Fridge bulb).
PACKAGE CONTENTS: 1 Himalayan Salt Lamp with 1 Power Cable (with Bulb Holder ) and 2 Pigmy Bulbs 15W each. SHAPE: Egg DIMENSIONS: 10 cm x 10 cm x 20 cm WEIGHT: 3-4 KG COLOR: Pink
PLACING YOUR SALT LAMP: From research, every half kilogram of Himalayan Salt Crystal cleans up the air in about 4 x 4 feet area. So, a lamp up to 5 Kg is good enough for a bedroom, whereas for a large living room or open area, a bigger lamp (7-15 Kg) may be more suitable. The best places to place a salt lamp are bed sides, study tables, side tables or your office reception tables. KEEP AWAY FROM WATER TO AVOID SALT FROM DISSOLVING

"All Naturals Salt Lamp Wrought Iron Basket with Salt Chunks Unique Gift (On/Off Wire), Natural Air Purifier for Vastu, Feng Shui, Home Decor, Healing, Peace & Harmony","2.2 out of 5 stars","NOT HAVING A HIMALAYAN SALT LAMP IN YOUR HOME OR OFFICE IS LIKE NOT HAVING A WINDOW!! All Naturals Himalayan Pink Salt Lamp is exactly what you need to bring positivity to your surroundings, and, most importantly to your mind, in these stressful times, along with a unique addition to your décor.
HOW A SALT LAMP WORKS: Salt, being hygroscopic, attracts water molecules from the air that hold dirt, pollen, smoke and bacteria. When heated, the lamp evaporates the water and the pollutants remain on the lamp. This purifies the air. When heated, the lamp releases negative ions into the air neutralizing the positive ions released by appliances like Mobiles, Laptops, TV, Fridge, AC etc., thereby reducing static electricity and electromagnetic radiation, resulting in sound sleep.
BENEFITS OF A SALT LAMP: Promotes sound sleep. Purifies & Deodorizes the Air. Neutralizes Electromagnetic Radiation. Eases Coughing. May reduce symptoms of Allergy & Asthma. Improves Mood & Concentration. Reduce Static Electricity in the Air. Known to increase Energy Levels. Environmentally-Friendly – Runs on 15W inexpensive bulb (Pigmy or Fridge bulb).
PACKAGE CONTENTS: 1 Himalayan Rock Salt Lamp With 2 Bulb 15W (for heating) and 1 Power Cable with Holder & ON/OFF switch. SHAPE: Cube with Cut Corners DIMENSIONS: 13 cm x 13 cm x 15 cm WEIGHT: 4-5 KG COLOR: Pink
PLACING YOUR SALT LAMP: From research, every half kilogram of Himalayan Salt Crystal cleans up the air in about 4 x 4 feet area. So, a lamp up to 5 Kg is good enough for a bedroom, whereas for a large living room or open area, a bigger lamp (8-15 Kg) may be more suitable. The best places to place a salt lamp is bed sides, study tables, side tables or your office reception tables. KEEP AWAY FROM WATER TO AVOID SALT FROM DISSOLVING

"VMTC Smoke Stop Air Purifier Filter with True Activated Carbon for Blueair 500/600 Series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","VMTC Smoke Stop Air purifier Filter with true Activated carbon for Blueair 500/600. Designed specifically to fit the Blueair 505, 605. Particle filter with active carbon for use in rooms where removal of heavy gaseous pollutants, such as tobacco smoke or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is required. Effective against PM 2.5, Pollen, Dust, Pet Dander, Mood, Bacteria, Virus, Dust Mites, VOCs, Smoke, Cooking Odour, Chemicals.
Airborne particles pass through a chamber of the VMTC air purifier to get electrically charged before passing through the gradient structure of our filters. The charge causes the polluted particles to adhere effortlessly to the filter media, capturing even fine particles such as tobacco smoke.
The gradient structure of VMTC filters traps particles of all sizes while maintaining maximum airflow. It resists clogging and wont re-release particles back into the air, even when the filter is heavily loaded. VMTC filter media is ultrasonically bonded to prevent filter fibers and other particles from being added back into your environment. The only thing that comes out of our filters is clean air!
VMTC Smoke Stop filters have a highly porous structure made of activated carbon to trap gases and odors. The naturally antibacterial polypropylene fibers in VMTC filters prevent bacteria and mold growth, so our filters never put bacteria and mold back into the air.
VMTC filters save energy thanks to its low dense design and the fact that less pressure is needed to push air through the filters. Our filters are also recyclable, so the only thing you’re adding back into the environment is clean air. Due to the use of both electrostatic and mechanical filtration, the filter media in VMTC filters is less dense than comparable media. Lower density enables air to move through the filter at a lower pressure, so you get high performance with a whisper-silent delive
